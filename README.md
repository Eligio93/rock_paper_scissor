# rock_paper_scissor

In this project i had to build the game Rock, paper, scissor in javascript through the use of functions, loops and if...else statement. i had trouble in the variable declarations, so at the beginning, and then i had a problem with the score. The problem was that i was calling the function for the round twice and i left the extra part as comment. So removing that part everything worked in the right way.
